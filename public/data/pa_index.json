Community-centred approaches \ninclude both bottom-up, voluntary community actions and activities, and top-down strategies that are informed by, and responsive \ntoo, the community concerned (36). At its core, competencies in community-centredness aims to build an environment where \nwell informed citizens can take decisions and responsibilities regarding their own health, and to enhance community capacity and \nengagement in public health planning, service design and delivery, and emergency preparedness and response.\nCompetency 1: Promotes health equity among individuals and communities\nBehaviours\n1.1\tContributes to the systematic identification and elimination of inequities resulting from differences in \nconditions for health \n1.2\tWorks to address unequal conditions experienced by groups, including the wider determinants of health and \ninequity3  \n1.3\tAdvocates for public health decision-making, planning and action that prioritizes the most vulnerable groups \nand addresses the greatest health inequities\n1.4\tPractises social accountability4  \nCompetency 2: Enables people to increase control over, and to improve, their health and lives\nBehaviours\n2.1\tStrives to mobilize, and enhance the effectiveness of, community assets\n2.2\tParticipates in mechanisms for community collaboration and social mobilization\n2.3\tPromotes the principles of community collaboration, social mobilization, co-design, co-delivery and codecision-making\n2.4\tPromotes social infrastructure for community participation, including the development of community leaders (L)\n2.5\tFacilitates the inclusion of women, youths and other often excluded voices in participatory approaches to \npublic health (L)\n2.6\tMotivates others to take ownership of the public health mission (L)\nCompetency 3: Fosters inclusive and participatory approaches to public health \nthat embrace cultural diversity and inclusion\nBehaviours\n3.1\tPromotes participation of affected individuals and communities, and cultural safety in public health practice \n3.2\tDemonstrates respect for the autonomy, goals, perspectives, preferences, priorities, rights and values of all \npeople \n3.3\tAdopts an approach to engagement that is inclusive, non-discriminatory, non-judgmental and nonstigmatizing\n3.4\tSeeks to mitigate the impact of individual beliefs, biases, emotional responses and values on decisions, \nactions and communication\n3.5\tChampions a culture of zero tolerance for racism, discrimination and stigma\n3.6\tTakes positive action to avoid and dispel abuse, harassment and other disruptive behaviours\n3\t\nThe determinants of health may be structural (rooted in key institutions and processes of the socioeconomic and political context) or intermediary (material circumstances; \npsychosocial circumstances; behavioural and/or biological factors; and the health system itself). There is no fixed list of those determinants, but they are broadly taken to \ninclude: behavioural, commercial, cultural, economic, environmental, political and social determinants (87).\n4\t\nSocial accountability of individuals is a commitment to respond as well as possible to the priority health needs of the community, region and/or nation that they are mandated \nto serve (adapted from (88,89)).\n\n\nGlobal competency and outcomes framework for the essential public health functions\n26\n2.6 Competency domain II: Decision-making\nAll members of the public health workforce make decisions daily that impact on and contribute to \nthe goals of public health. Individual decisions about their practice affect communication, evidence \ninterpretation, approach to practice and community engagement, all while adapting to the specific \ncontext. These decisions have various impacts within the public health ecosystem, for example, an impact \non the experience and engagement of individuals and communities, the effectiveness of collaborative \npractices, the use and stewardship of scarce resources, and the approach to collective decisions about \nprogrammes, interventions and systems oriented to specific contexts and health goals. Decision-making, \nwhether at the individual or the collective level, should embody the ethics and values of public health.\nCompetency 4: Takes an evidence-informed approach to decision-making \nBehaviours\n4.1\tSeeks feedback, information and evidence from a range of sources and stakeholders when \napproaching decision-making\n4.2\tDemonstrates critical thinking to reach decisions that are well reasoned, ethical, evidenceinformed, feasible, timely and based on the best available information (L)\n4.3\tNavigates evidence gaps, ethical situations and influences from external factors such as \npolitical drivers, misinformation and media campaigns, in decision-making (L)\nCompetency 5: Applies systems thinking to public health problem-solving\nBehaviours\n5.1\tTakes initiative to identify and anticipate problems and opportunities\n5.2\tAnticipates the health and intersectional consequences of decisions, actions and inaction \n5.3\tFocuses on solutions, end goals and results\n5.4\tEngages with problems and problem-solving from many different viewpoints (L)\n5.5\tPromotes positive relationships with and between humans, animals and environments, and \nbetween the ecosystem partners and sectors that affect public health (L)\n5.6\tIdentifies opportunities for growth, innovation, change and redirection towards improved \nconditions for population health and equity (L) \nCompetency 6: Adapts to unexpected or rapidly changing situations\nBehaviours\n6.1\tMaintains situational awareness\n6.2\tAdjusts priorities to respond to changing situations and demands\n6.3\tDemonstrates flexibility and patience \n6.4\tDemonstrates calmness, respect and kindness under pressure \n6.5\tAdopts agile thinking characterized by flexibility, adaptability, iterative problem-solving and \nresponsiveness to change (L)\n6.6\tAdapts the approach to decision-making to reflect the complexity, urgency, availability or \nabsence of information and consequences of the decision (L) \n\n\n5\t\n“All people” signifies irrespective of age, asylum or migration status, criminal record, culture, disability, economic status, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, health \nliteracy, health status, language, nationality, ethnicity, Indigeneity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, treatment adherence, vulnerability to ill-health and other characteristics.\n2.7 Competency domain III: Communication\nCommunication is fundamental to the daily activities undertaken by individual members of the public health workforce. \nCommunication can take various forms: it may be direct or indirect, and may utilize written, visual, verbal or non-verbal \napproaches and digital tools. The competencies within this domain are focused on facilitating effective and impactful \ncommunication in individual work, inclusive of interactions with colleagues and a range of stakeholders, including \ngovernments, associations, institutions and schools of public health, civil society groups, communities’ and development \npartners’ emergency operations centres, and media outlets; or for public health communication tasks, such as behavioural \nchange communication and public health campaigns. \nCompetency 7: Communicates actively and attentively\nBehaviours\n7.1\t Presents information clearly, coherently, concisely and logically\n7.2\tListens actively, using a range of non-verbal cues and verbal affirmations\n7.3\tClarifies understanding of information from other people\n7.4\tResponds sensitively and thoughtfully to others\n7.5\tWorks to overcome communication barriers, including those due to cognitive, physical or sensory impairment, \nculture, geography or language\n7.6\tFacilitates meaningful dialogue among communities, partners and other stakeholders, including across sectors (L)\n7.7\tPromotes inclusive communications by creating opportunities for others to express their views and insights, \nincluding those without positions of power (L)\nCompetency 8: Conveys information purposefully, including through trusted platforms and key partners\nBehaviours\n8.1\tProvides timely, relevant, accurate and complete information\n8.2\tAdopts strategies that encourage common understanding of information and decisions\n8.3\tExpresses professional perspectives with clarity, confidence and respect, based on the best available evidence\n8.4\tEngages with trusted platforms and key partners in disseminating communication messages to achieve \ncommon communication goals\n8.5\tAdvocates for communication mechanisms that engage communities and key partners (L)\nCompetency 9: Adapts communication to the contextual goals, needs, urgency and sensitivity of the \nsituation\nBehaviours\n9.1\tClarifies with others the intended audience, goals and timelines for communications \n9.2\tAdapts the style, language and methods of communication to the audience and context, considering needs, \nurgency, confidentiality and sensitivity\n9.3\tUses a range of communication tools, technologies and approaches to inform, persuade, influence, negotiate \nand mediate \n9.4\tDemonstrates compassion, cultural sensitivity, empathy and respect for all people5 (e.g. using gender-inclusive \nlanguage that does not reinforce stereotypes)\n\n\nGlobal competency and outcomes framework for the essential public health functions\n28\n2.8 Competency domain IV: Collaboration\nPublic health challenges are inherently dynamic, transcending intersectoral, intrasectoral and even \nnational boundaries, and necessitating collective action across sectors, organizations and communities. \nIn the face of complex health issues, collaboration is a cornerstone for effective action. At the heart \nof public health values lies the fundamental principle of community collaboration and mobilization. \nCollaboration in public health must be standard practice, recognizing that no single member of the public \nhealth workforce can manage the complexities of public health. Mobilizing and collaborating with other \nindividuals, communities and interest groups is vital for the effective implementation of public health \nactions, as part of a whole-of-society approach. By fostering these collaborations, individual workers can \neffectively address the multifaceted nature of public health and work collectively to improve population \nhealth outcomes. Collaboration also enables avoidance of duplication of services in a given community, \nand the incorporation of public health orientation into wider work that affects public health. By harnessing \nthe strengths of diverse stakeholders, collaborative efforts can create comprehensive strategies that \naddress the complex nature of public health challenges. In essence, collaboration is not just an option but \na necessity: the pursuit of a healthier society requires collective commitment and coordinated efforts by \neveryone.\nCompetency 10: Engages in collaborative practice within and between defined teams6\nBehaviours\n10.1\tEngages in opportunities to improve collaboration within and between teams\n10.2\tWorks towards shared goals while respecting individual roles and responsibilities\n10.3\tSupports team decisions even when personal preferences differ\n10.4\tJointly distributes roles and responsibilities to maximize strengths within a team\n10.5\tTakes accountability for individual contributions to the team’s work\n10.6\tCreates opportunities for team listening, dialoguing, negotiating, rewarding, encouraging and \nmotivating (L)\nCompetency 11: Engages in collaborative practice within partnerships and coalitions7\nBehaviours\n11.1\t Engages with others as partners across cultural, geographical, hierarchical, organizational, \nreligious and sectoral boundaries \n11.2\tFosters transparent, constructive, collaborative and mutually accountable working \nrelationships with others\n11.3\tStrives to develop positive rapport with others, characterized by respect, humility, inclusivity, \nsupport and trust\n11.4\t Seeks to establish a shared mission, vision and purpose, and trusting relationships (L)\n11.5\tBuilds and maintains meaningful interprofessional, interdisciplinary and intersectoral \ncollaborations and partnerships (L)",

There is no fixed list of those determinants, but they are broadly taken to \ninclude: behavioural, commercial, cultural, economic, environmental, political and social determinants (87).\n4\t\nSocial accountability of individuals is a commitment to respond as well as possible to the priority health needs of the community, region and/or nation that they are mandated \nto serve (adapted from (88,89)).\n\n\nGlobal competency and outcomes framework for the essential public health functions\n26\n2.6 Competency domain II: Decision-making\nAll members of the public health workforce make decisions daily that impact on and contribute to \nthe goals of public health. Individual decisions about their practice affect communication, evidence \ninterpretation, approach to practice and community engagement, all while adapting to the specific \ncontext. These decisions have various impacts within the public health ecosystem, for example, an impact \non the experience and engagement of individuals and communities, the effectiveness of collaborative \npractices, the use and stewardship of scarce resources, and the approach to collective decisions about \nprogrammes, interventions and systems oriented to specific contexts and health goals. Decision-making, \nwhether at the individual or the collective level, should embody the ethics and values of public health.\nCompetency 4: Takes an evidence-informed approach to decision-making \nBehaviours\n4.1\tSeeks feedback, information and evidence from a range of sources and stakeholders when \napproaching decision-making\n4.2\tDemonstrates critical thinking to reach decisions that are well reasoned, ethical, evidenceinformed, feasible, timely and based on the best available information (L)\n4.3\tNavigates evidence gaps, ethical situations and influences from external factors such as \npolitical drivers, misinformation and media campaigns, in decision-making (L)\nCompetency 5: Applies systems thinking to public health problem-solving\nBehaviours\n5.1\tTakes initiative to identify and anticipate problems and opportunities\n5.2\tAnticipates the health and intersectional consequences of decisions, actions and inaction \n5.3\tFocuses on solutions, end goals and results\n5.4\tEngages with problems and problem-solving from many different viewpoints (L)\n5.5\tPromotes positive relationships with and between humans, animals and environments, and \nbetween the ecosystem partners and sectors that affect public health (L)\n5.6\tIdentifies opportunities for growth, innovation, change and redirection towards improved \nconditions for population health and equity (L) \nCompetency 6: Adapts to unexpected or rapidly changing situations\nBehaviours\n6.1\tMaintains situational awareness\n6.2\tAdjusts priorities to respond to changing situations and demands\n6.3\tDemonstrates flexibility and patience \n6.4\tDemonstrates calmness, respect and kindness under pressure \n6.5\tAdopts agile thinking characterized by flexibility, adaptability, iterative problem-solving and \nresponsiveness to change (L)\n6.6\tAdapts the approach to decision-making to reflect the complexity, urgency, availability or \nabsence of information and consequences of the decision (L) \n\n\n5\t\n“All people” signifies irrespective of age, asylum or migration status, criminal record, culture, disability, economic status, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, health \nliteracy, health status, language, nationality, ethnicity, Indigeneity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, treatment adherence, vulnerability to ill-health and other characteristics.\n2.7 Competency domain III: Communication\nCommunication is fundamental to the daily activities undertaken by individual members of the public health workforce. \nCommunication can take various forms: it may be direct or indirect, and may utilize written, visual, verbal or non-verbal \napproaches and digital tools. The competencies within this domain are focused on facilitating effective and impactful \ncommunication in individual work, inclusive of interactions with colleagues and a range of stakeholders, including \ngovernments, associations, institutions and schools of public health, civil society groups, communities’ and development \npartners’ emergency operations centres, and media outlets; or for public health communication tasks, such as behavioural \nchange communication and public health campaigns. \nCompetency 7: Communicates actively and attentively\nBehaviours\n7.1\t Presents information clearly, coherently, concisely and logically\n7.2\tListens actively, using a range of non-verbal cues and verbal affirmations\n7.3\tClarifies understanding of information from other people\n7.4\tResponds sensitively and thoughtfully to others\n7.5\tWorks to overcome communication barriers, including those due to cognitive, physical or sensory impairment, \nculture, geography or language\n7.6\tFacilitates meaningful dialogue among communities, partners and other stakeholders, including across sectors (L)\n7.7\tPromotes inclusive communications by creating opportunities for others to express their views and insights, \nincluding those without positions of power (L)\nCompetency 8: Conveys information purposefully, including through trusted platforms and key partners\nBehaviours\n8.1\tProvides timely, relevant, accurate and complete information\n8.2\tAdopts strategies that encourage common understanding of information and decisions\n8.3\tExpresses professional perspectives with clarity, confidence and respect, based on the best available evidence\n8.4\tEngages with trusted platforms and key partners in disseminating communication messages to achieve \ncommon communication goals\n8.5\tAdvocates for communication mechanisms that engage communities and key partners (L)\nCompetency 9: Adapts communication to the contextual goals, needs, urgency and sensitivity of the \nsituation\nBehaviours\n9.1\tClarifies with others the intended audience, goals and timelines for communications \n9.2\tAdapts the style, language and methods of communication to the audience and context, considering needs, \nurgency, confidentiality and sensitivity\n9.3\tUses a range of communication tools, technologies and approaches to inform, persuade, influence, negotiate \nand mediate \n9.4\tDemonstrates compassion, cultural sensitivity, empathy and respect for all people5 (e.g. using gender-inclusive \nlanguage that does not reinforce stereotypes)\n\n\nGlobal competency and outcomes framework for the essential public health functions\n28\n2.8 Competency domain IV: Collaboration\nPublic health challenges are inherently dynamic, transcending intersectoral, intrasectoral and even \nnational boundaries, and necessitating collective action across sectors, organizations and communities. \nIn the face of complex health issues, collaboration is a cornerstone for effective action. At the heart \nof public health values lies the fundamental principle of community collaboration and mobilization. \nCollaboration in public health must be standard practice, recognizing that no single member of the public \nhealth workforce can manage the complexities of public health. Mobilizing and collaborating with other \nindividuals, communities and interest groups is vital for the effective implementation of public health \nactions, as part of a whole-of-society approach. By fostering these collaborations, individual workers can \neffectively address the multifaceted nature of public health and work collectively to improve population \nhealth outcomes. Collaboration also enables avoidance of duplication of services in a given community, \nand the incorporation of public health orientation into wider work that affects public health. By harnessing \nthe strengths of diverse stakeholders, collaborative efforts can create comprehensive strategies that \naddress the complex nature of public health challenges. In essence, collaboration is not just an option but \na necessity: the pursuit of a healthier society requires collective commitment and coordinated efforts by \neveryone.\nCompetency 10: Engages in collaborative practice within and between defined teams6\nBehaviours\n10.1\tEngages in opportunities to improve collaboration within and between teams\n10.2\tWorks towards shared goals while respecting individual roles and responsibilities\n10.3\tSupports team decisions even when personal preferences differ\n10.4\tJointly distributes roles and responsibilities to maximize strengths within a team\n10.5\tTakes accountability for individual contributions to the team’s work\n10.6\tCreates opportunities for team listening, dialoguing, negotiating, rewarding, encouraging and \nmotivating (L)\nCompetency 11: Engages in collaborative practice within partnerships and coalitions7\nBehaviours\n11.1\t Engages with others as partners across cultural, geographical, hierarchical, organizational, \nreligious and sectoral boundaries \n11.2\tFosters transparent, constructive, collaborative and mutually accountable working \nrelationships with others\n11.3\tStrives to develop positive rapport with others, characterized by respect, humility, inclusivity, \nsupport and trust\n11.4\t Seeks to establish a shared mission, vision and purpose, and trusting relationships (L)\n11.5\tBuilds and maintains meaningful interprofessional, interdisciplinary and intersectoral \ncollaborations and partnerships (L)",
